# Java-Concurrency
Thread and Concurrency
A scribeâ€™s job is to record something to paper.
To write, a scribe needs a pen and an ink bottle. These resources cannot be used by more
than one scribe, so i managed them using concurrency primitives.
When a scribe gets both a pen and an ink bottle, he will write a record and put both the
pen and the bottle back until next time
